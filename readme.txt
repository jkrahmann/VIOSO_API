This library is meant to use in image generators, to do warping and blending. It takes a .vwf export and a texture buffer 
to sample from. If no texture buffer is given, it uses a copy of the current back buffer. It will render to the currently set back buffer.
It provides image based warping, suitable for most cases and, if a 3D map is provided, dynamc eye warping.
Usage: 
1. Static binding, having VIOSOWarpBlend next to your executable or in added to %path%:
link against VIOSOWarpBlend.lib and, in your [precompiled] header.
#include "VIOSOWarpBlend.h"

2. Dynamic binding, giving a path to load dynamic library from:
#define VIOSOWARPBLEND_FILE with a path (relative to main executable), this defaults to VIOSOWarpBlend / VIOSOWarpBlend64
2a) via [precompiled] header:
in header declare functions and types:
#define VIOSOWARPBLEND_DYNAMIC_DEFINE
#include "VIOSOWarpBlend.h"

in one file on top, to implement the actual functions/objects
#define VIOSOWARPBLEND_DYNAMIC_IMPLEMENT
#include "VIOSOWarpBlend.h"

in module initialization, this loads function pointers from library
#define VIOSOWARPBLEND_DYNAMIC_INITIALIZE
#include "VIOSOWarpBlend.h"

---
2b) Single file
in file on top, to declare and implement functions/objects,
#define VIOSOWARPBLEND_DYNAMIC_DEFINE_IMPLEMENT
#include "VIOSOWarpBlend.h"

in module initialization, this loads function pointers from library
#define VIOSOWARPBLEND_DYNAMIC_INITIALIZE
#include "VIOSOWarpBlend.h"

Always make sure to have your platform headers loaded before!
To access deprecated functions #define VWB_USE_DEPRECATED_INIT

@Remarks
To allocate a warper, call VWB_Create. A specified config file is read.
You might edit all settings in warper struct. Then call VWB_Init.
There is no logical maximum on the number of allocated warpers.
Call VWB_getViewProj to obtain view and projection matrices relative to some eye point.
Call VWB_render to warp scene to screen. There is no multi-threading inside VIOSOWarpBlend module, make sure to use same thread or make your GL-context current before calling VWB_render.

You need VIOSO Calibrator to export a warp map as Vioso Warp File.
This API can use all mappings. In case you export 3D, you have to specify view parameter.
The eye point correction algorithm works implicitly. Imagine a rectangular "window" placed virtually near next to the screen.
It must be situated the way that from every possible (dynamic) eye point the whole projection area of the regarded projector
is seen through tat window.
This leads to an asymetrical frustum for a dynamic eye-point, which leads us to a projection-view-matrix mPV.
If you use that matrix in conjunction with the world matrix, one can render this "window" to provide all information needed
on the screen for that projector.
The map provided for the projector has 3D-coordinates of the actual screen for every pixel. If you multiply such a 
3D coordinate with mPV it leads to the u-v-coordinate in the "window". So if we sample in the provided backbuffer,
we can fill every pixel with content.
Here we define the rectangle. We do that in the familiar way of defining a standard frustum. The only additional information s the 
distance, where the screen will be (screen). These values come from a configuraton file or can be entered in settings.
